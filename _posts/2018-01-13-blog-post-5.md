This blog summurize the whole application process upto I got the offer from Microsoft. I shared my experience hopefully is usefully for those who are interested in the Microsoft internship program. This application might be different from the general internship application process. However, I think that this approach is actually much effective than applying from the Microsoft career website by which you don't know what projects or field syou can work on, what expertist they are looking for. 

Timeline

Preparation of the application
------
As you can see in the timeline, the most time I spent on this application is talk to people and actually I believe this is the most essential factor for the sucess of this application. I also spent quite some time on my resume, tailor it to the one that I though is most suitable for this application. 

There are two students I know worked in the Microsoft summer program. One of them worked in the same team I was applying to. I talked to both of them in order to know: 1) how they apply for the internship 2) the detail of the internship and the projects. I tailored my resume to highlight those skill and experience which is required.

I also talked to my supervisor who worked closely with the team I was applying to. I asked for the permission for putting her name as my reference in the application.

I finally submit my application after over 2 weeks preparation in the late Friday afternoon and got their response in an hour.

Interviews
------
I had two interviews over skype. The first one with the manager, generally chated about my current project, my interest and he breifly introduced his team and their work to me. 

The second one is the coding interview. I had never done any coding interview before and I have less than a week for the preparation. I know there is a lot of examples and coding execise website online. However, I forgot even the basic concepts of most of the algorithms since I learned those years ago and didn't get that much chance to use them in my daily work and research. So instead of doing the coding execise, I spent the very limited time I had to go through the most fundamental algorithms on the book I brought last year but never touched. I only got to read 5 chapters and solve the exercise problems at the end of each chapter. I don't think that my preparation is enough and I worked perfectly in the coding interview. But with the very limit time, I did my best, spend 5 day full time working on it.

* The book I read is one of the most popular interview prepration book: * <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0/135-1906838-7751814?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=F62TW51B2D33ZDF84EV2">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>. I read these chapters: Arrays and Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Trees and Graphs, Sorting and Searching.

* The quetion I got is: given a binary tree, print it out level by level in a zig-zag manner.
  * Example: 
     * the tree

         .......a.........

         ....b.......c.... 

         ..d...e...f...g.. 
         
         .h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.
    * print result: a-c-b-d-e-f-g-o-n-m-l-k-j-i-h
  * My brute force solution:

```
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode root, int level, List<List<TreeNode>> lists){
   
   if(root != null) {  
    List<TreeNode> list = lists.get(level);    
    if(list == null){
        List<TreeNode> list = new ArrayList<TreeNode>();
        lists.add(level, list);
    }   
    list.add(root);
    preOrderTraversal(root.left, level+1, lists);
    preOrderTraversal(root.right, level+1, lists);
       
   }

}

void printTree(TreeNode root){
  List<List<TreeNode>> lists = new ArrayLsit<ArrayList<TreeNode>>();
  
  preOrderTraversal(root, 0, lists);
  
  for(int i = 0; i < list.lenght; i++)
  {
      List<TreeNode> list = lists.get(i);
      if(i%2 == 0){
          \\print from left to right;
      }else{
          \\print from right to left
      }
  }
  
  
}

public class TreeNode{
   public char data;
   public TreeNode left;
   public TreeNode right;
}
```


About the offer
------
I got the official offer from HR directly on January 8th, Monday morning. 


Summary
------
This internship application actually is the first job hunting in North America. I would not say this is luch since I did spend quite some time on it for two reason: 1) I really want this internship 2) I treat this as an execise for the future full-time job hunting. 

Talking to people and got their support is the bigest lesson I learned from this application. People sometimes heistate to talk to people expesially when they are hunting job for some reasons. However, with other successful experince and even reference, it make your job hunting much easier to success. 

And I really want to thank those who help me on the way: my friends who read and fixed the problem in my resume and provided valuable feedback. My friend who is working in Amazon share her interview experience and her resume to me. My lab mates who talked to me about the internship and also gave suggestion my the application. And all my friends who supported me. And of course my family, they are the best.
