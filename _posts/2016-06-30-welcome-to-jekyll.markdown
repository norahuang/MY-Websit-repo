<p>When I decided to have my own website, I do a little research about all website platform providers. After filtering, there are three for me: <a href="http://www.simplesite.com/">simplesite</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>.</p>

<p>And finally I chose github for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. It can refer directly to the projects and material I store on website</p>
<p>2. I can write my own html file which give me a learning opportunity</p>
<p>3. It compile to the way I am working such as using eclispe, terminal and git to manage the website project.</p>
