excerpt: 'The algorithm for multi-component signal processing against the background of linear frequency modulated continuous wave(LFMCW) in electronic reconnaissance is discussed.The pulse signals can be detected from the continue-wave background by analyzing every time slice of the short-time Fourier transform exerted on the received signal.By filtering the LFM pulse signals and remaining the component of the CW signal,the periodic time-frequency curve of LFMCW radar signal can be obtained.According to characters of the spectrum of the time-frequency curve,the main parameters of the LFMCW signal can be estimated.Then,by filtering LFMCW component from pulse signals,the parameters of the LFM pulse signals can be estimated by the relative algorithms.Simulation results indicate that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of LFMCW signals and LFM pulse signals.When SNR of the LFMCW signals is higher than(-8 dB) and its power is 6 dB lower compared with LFM pulse signals,the performance of the algorithm is stable and the precision is good.'
