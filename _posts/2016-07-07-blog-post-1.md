Use virtual machines to setup your own distributed system.

Settings:
------
* Host OS: MAC OS
* Virtual machine OS(guest OS): ubuntu
* Virtualization tool: Virtualbox, it seems to be the most suitable one for MAC, free and
easy to use, if your host is linux or windows, you can have other choices, such as
VMware.

Steps:
------
* Download and install Virtualbox from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">virtualbox</a> 
* Create several VMs with the default options. (I have master, worker1, worker2)
* Download ubuntu iso for VMs, ubuntu iso can be found in <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download">ubuntu</a> 
* Start the VMs and install ubuntu on each VM
* apt install on VMs (when you need to access outside network use NAT network option in settings->network, otherwise host-only adapter is good for internal communication between VMs and VM-host.)
  * sudo apt install golang-go
  * sudo apt install nfs-common
  * sudo apt install ssh
  * sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
* Create a new disk on master
  * power off master vm
  * settings->storage->+->create a sata control disk
  * power on master vm
  * config the disk 
    * Run
      * sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
      * Then type o and press enter # creates a new table
      * Then type n and press enter # creates a new partition
      * Then type p and press enter # makes a primary partition.
      * Then type 1 and press enter # creates it as the 1st partition
      * (use default setting in this step)
      * Finally type w # this will write any changes to disk.
      * Okay now you have a partition, now you need a filesystem.
    * Run
      * sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
    * add below line into /etc/fstab
      * /dev/sdb1 /home/yourname/GO ext4 defaults 0 1
    * create a floder /home/yourname/GO on your master
      * mkdir /home/yourname/GO
  * restart master
*  share the folder /home/yourname/GO on master
  * add below line in /etc/exports
    * /home/yourname/GO ipaddress of your workers(rw)
  * service nfs-kernel-server restart
* mount the folder on master to the workers, on workers, execute
  * mkdir /home/yourname/GO
  * mount -t nfs ipaddressOfmaster:/home/yourname/GO /home/yourname/GO
* set the GOPATH on all vms, you can add the line below to ~/.bashrc
  * export GOPATH=/home/yourname/GO
* open a new terminal
* Put your mapreduce code on to one of your vmâ€™s /home/yourname/GO/src as well as the kjv12.txt file, organize them in below structure will make things easier
  * /home/yourname/GO/src
    * kjv12.txt
    * wc.go
  * /home/yourname/GO/src/mapreduce
    * common.go
    * worker.go
    * master.go
    * mapreduce.go
* Change the code of you mapreduce using tcp rpc instead of unix one.
* On master
  * go run wc.go master kjv12.txt ipaddressOfmaster:7777
* On workers
  * go run wc.go worker ipaddressOfmaster:7777 ipaddressOfthisWorker:portyoulike
